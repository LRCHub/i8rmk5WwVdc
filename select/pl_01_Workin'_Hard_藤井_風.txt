掻っ攫った 圧巻でらした
あらら 世は実に易し
信じ切った 安心し切った
あたた 深き喜び
戦うは なぎ倒すは か弱い己自身さ
やり切って胸はって
綺麗に散るのさ～
みんなほんまよーやるわ
めっちゃがんばっとるわ
わしかて負けんよーにな
ひそかに何かと努めるわ
なんも無くたっていいや
結果なんぞかったりーわ
Better sit back
Take a deep breath
And you'll know...
You've been workin' hard
Workin' hard
Maybe you don't understand
But I know that you're
Workin' hard
Workin' hard
Wish I could give you a hand
Baby you've been
Workin' hard
Workin' hard
Trust the process and be brave
You've been workin' hard
God you've been workin' hard
Let's sit back, time to relax
鼓動に任せて自由に踊って
Bow down, show them respect
敵も味方もここにはねえから
Sit back, time to relax
鼓動に任せて自由に踊って
Bow down, show them respect
敵も味方もほんまはねえから
みんなほんまよーやるわ
めっちゃがんばっとるわ
わしかて負けんよーにな
ひそかに何かと努めるわ
なんも無くたっていいや
結果なんぞかったりーわ
Better sit back
Take a deep breath
And you'll know...
You've been workin' hard
Workin' hard
Maybe you don't understand
But I know that you're
Workin' hard
Workin' hard
Wish I could give you a hand

Workin' hard
Workin' hard
Trust the process and be brave
You've been workin' hard
